  abstract = {Summer droughts in North America’s northern Great Plains are expected to increase in frequency and duration as precipitation shifts toward spring and fall. Two rangeland experimental stations in North Dakota experienced drought in 2017 relative to 25-year averages. The southwest location had a 170-mm deﬁcit from the 360-mm normal rainfall and was grazed by cattle (Bos taurus L.) and sheep (Ovis aries L.); the south-central location had 109 mm below the 403-mm normal rainfall and was grazed by cattle. We evaluated patch-burn grazing as a drought resilient land management strategy in the northern Great Plains by comparing average daily gains, fecal density, available forage biomass, and forage crude protein content. At the southwest location, livestock performed better during the drought season compared with animals on the same pastures in the previous year, which had near-normal rainfall but no ﬁre. At the central location, cows on patch-burned pastures performed better than cows on continuously-grazed, unburned pastures in the same year under drought conditions; all cows were nursing calves and calf gains did not vary between treatments. In both locations, the burned patches had higher fecal density and lower available forage biomass than patches not yet burned throughout the grazing season, indicating grazer attraction to burned areas. Despite drought, burned patches maintained grazer attraction and animal performance was maintained or even improved, which contrasts with the expected relationship between animal performance and precipitation. This study indicated that prescribed patch-burning might mitigate drought by buffering forage resources (crude protein content and availability) and maintaining animal performance (average daily gains).},

  abstract = {Ecological disturbances frequently control the occurrence and patterning of dominant plants in high-diversity communities like C4 grasslands and savannas. In such ecosystems disturbance-related processes can have important implications for species, and for whole communities when those species are dominant, yet mechanistic understanding of such processes remains fragmentary. Multiple bunchgrass species commonly co-dominate disturbance-dependent and species-rich pine savannas, where small-scale fuel heterogeneity may influence bunchgrass survival and growth following fires. We quantified how fire in locally varying fuel loads influenced dynamics of dominant C4 bunchgrasses in a species-rich pine savanna in southeastern Louisiana, USA. We focused on two congeneric, co-dominant species (Schizachyrium scoparium and S. tenerum) with similar growth forms, functional traits and reproductive strategies to highlight effects of fuel heterogeneity during fires. In experimental plots with either reduced or increased fuels versus controls with unmanipulated fuels, we compared: 1) bunchgrass damage and 2) mortality from fires; 3) subsequent growth and 4) flowering. Compared to controls, fire with increased fuels caused greater damage, mortality and subsequent flowering, but did not affect post-fire growth. Fire with reduced fuels had no effect on any of the four measures. The two species responded differently to fire with increased fuels – S. scoparium incurred measurably more damage and mortality than S. tenerum. Logistic regression indicated that the larger average size of S. tenerum tussocks made them resistant to more severe burning where fuels were increased. We speculate that locally increased fuel loading may be important in pine savannas for creating colonization sites because where fuels are light or moderate, dominant bunchgrasses persist through fires. Small-scale heterogeneity in fires, and differences in how species tolerate fire may together promote shared local dominance by different bunchgrasses.},

  abstract = {An understanding of fire behaviour and its impacts on natural ecosystems is essential for developing management strategies, specifically for planning prescribed fires. It is well known that vegetation and microclimate factors are important predictors of fire behaviour. However, the relative importance of these factors and how fire behaviour responds to changes in these factors are still understood, especially in the Brazilian Cerrado, which has strong seasonality and high vegetation heterogeneity. Here, we compiled literature data from 65 experimental fire plots in three vegetation types in the Cerrado biome—grasslands, savannas, and forests—corresponding to a gradient of increasing of woody cover. First, we evaluated how aspects of fire behaviour (fire spread rate, fire intensity, and heat released) and of fire-associated emissions (fine fuel consumption, combustion factor, and carbon emissions associated with fine fuel consumption) vary according to vegetation type. Subsequently, we evaluated the relative importance of vegetation (represented by woody cover and fine fuel load) and microclimatic factors (represented by vapour pressure deficit [VPD] and wind speed) in determining the fire behaviour and fire-associated emissions. Using generalised linear models, we evaluated the simultaneous influences of vegetation and microclimate variables (only for independent and non-collinear variables) on fire behaviour and fire-associated emissions. We found that aspects of fire behaviour and fire-associated emissions differed among the vegetation types: compared to forests, grasslands and savannas showed higher fire spread rates and fire intensities, consumed more fine fuel biomass, had larger combustion factors, released more heat, and emitted more carbon. The results show that the vegetation type, VPD and fine fuel load are key metrics for explain fire behaviour and fire-associated emissions in the Cerrado. The VPD was found to be the primary driver of the fire spread rate and fire intensity for all vegetation types and fine fuel load was the primary driver of heat released, fine fuel consumption, combustion factor, and carbon emissions in all vegetation types.},

  abstract = {Fire is critical to the maintenance of ecological function in many ecosystems worldwide, especially mesic sub-Saharan rangelands. But most rangeland fire research occurs in a wildfire context, is focused on fire effects, or simply assumes that grass-dominated fuelbeds are homogeneous. In this study, we sampled fuel moisture from several species in two grassland locations in South Africa to determine (1) if grassland fuels cure differently among species or across locations, (2) whether differences in curing meaningfully affect fire behaviour, and (3) if fuel moisture is associated with soil moisture. Data were characterised by high variability among sampling sites and dates, which highlights the importance of accounting for—rather than averaging out—variation with hierarchical analysis. Variability among locations and species indicates that broad similarities among plant communities do not adequately describe fuelbed dynamics. We observed patterns in the C3Festuca costata that deviated from general patterns in C4 grasses, particularly in grasslands at the edge of environmentally determined transitions. These differences might have landscape-level implications under global environmental change. The temporal breadth and species-level specificity of our study constitute novel data that identify further research to improve the understanding of fuelbed ecology in grasslands worldwide, beyond the context of extreme fire weather and behaviour. Our data suggest that managers in South Africa and abroad should consider heterogeneity within grassland fuelbeds and recognize seasonal changes to ensure that objectives are obtainable ahead of burns, and to explain spatial variation in response within what might have appeared to be a homogeneous grassland fuelbed.},

  abstract = {Forest-savanna mosaics are maintained by fire-mediated positive feedbacks; whereby forest is fire suppressive and savanna is fire promoting. Forest-savanna transitions therefore represent the interface of opposing fire regimes. Within the transition there is a threshold point at which tree canopy cover becomes sufficiently dense to shade out grasses and thus suppress fire. Prior to reaching this threshold, changes in fire behavior may already be occurring within the savanna. Such changes are neither empirically described nor their drivers understood. Fire behavior is largely driven by fuel flammability. Flammability can vary significantly between grass species and grass species composition can change near forest-savanna transitions. This study measured fire behavior changes at eighteen forest-savanna transition sites in a vegetation mosaic in Lopé National Park in Gabon, central Africa. The extent to which these changes could be attributed to changes in grass flammability was determined using species-specific flammability traits. Results showed simultaneous suppression of fire and grass biomass when tree canopy leaf area index (LAI) reached a value of 3, indicating that a fire suppression threshold existed within the forest-savanna transition. Fires became less intense and less hot prior to reaching this fire suppression threshold. These changes were associated with higher LAI values, which induced a change in the grass community, from one dominated by the highly flammable Anadelphia afzeliana to one dominated by the less flammable Hyparrhenia diplandra. Changes in fire behavior were not associated with changes in total grass biomass. This study demonstrated not only the presence of a fire suppression threshold but the mechanism of its action. Grass composition mediated fire-behavior within the savanna prior to reaching the suppression threshold, and grass species composition was mediated by tree canopy cover which was in turn mediated by fire-behavior. These findings highlight how biotic and abiotic controls interact and amplify each other in this mosaicked landscape to facilitate forest and savanna co-existence.},

  abstract = {Plant ecologists have long been interested in the effects of fire on vegetation. Thermocouples have been in their proverbial toolbox for decades, despite temperature not being a direct product or measure of wildland fire behaviour or fire effects. To better represent the cumulative impact of high-temperature exposure on organisms, ecologists often use temperature–time curves from thermocouples to calculate residence time—the duration of heat exposure above a threshold temperature—which can be used to calculate another popular metric, degree  \$\${\textbackslash}cdot \$\$seconds. A systematic literature review of 105 published papers shows that residence time, especially, and degree \$\${\textbackslash}cdot \$\$seconds are common metrics derived from raw temperature–time data. While several errors in thermocouple readings have been previously identified and addressed—responsiveness to heating, discrepancy between thermocouple temperature and actual temperature of the medium surrounding the thermocouple—this paper highlights a previously unconsidered source of error that must be reconciled for metrics like residence time to be biologically valid: the disproportionately long time it takes for thermocouples to cool once heat input is complete. Using an array of thermocouples in a fume hood over a Bunsen burner before and after the flame is extinguished, this paper shows that after being exposed to flame, 30-gauge K-type thermocouples require 80–100 s to register ambient temperatures despite taking only about 5 s to respond to heating. The review indicates ecologists give no consideration for this disproportionately slow cooling response. These findings indicate that residence time (and therefore degree \$\${\textbackslash}cdot \$\$seconds) have been over-estimated in the fire ecology literature. The proposed solution is to simply truncate temperature–time curves at the point temperature begins to decline, which indicates a shift from the biologically relevant effect of heat input to the biologically irrelevant, physical properties (heat diffusivity) of the thermocouple itself. Conceptual models present these biologically relevant portions of the temperature–time curve and identify parts of the biologically relevant curve that might be useful in quantifying components of flammability.},

Cool-season precipitation was 33\% below average in both years of the study, while warm-season precipitation was only slightly below average both years. Standing crop of current year's growth was increased by burning on overflow range sites, but not on silty range sites. Big bluestem (Andropogon gerardi) standing crop was greatest with mid-May burning. Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis) standing crop and leaf length were reduced with burning on both dates. Leaf length, basal area and number of inflorescences of native cool-season grasses were also reduced. Mid-May burning in drought years may be recommended for the reduction of Kentucky bluegrass. However, reductions in production of native cool-season vegetation can be expected on silty range sites. In contrast, mid-June burning in dry years is not recommended.},

Meeting this challenge will lay the foundation for predicting direct ecological effects of fires and fire–atmosphere coupling. In this paper, we focus on the relationships between the fire radiation field, as measured from the zenith, fuel consumption and the behaviour of spreading flame fronts. Experiments were conducted in 8 Â 8-m outdoor plots using preconditioned wildland fuels characteristic of mixed-oak forests of the eastern United States. Using dual-band radiometers with a field of view of ,18.5 m2 at a height of 4.2 m, we found a nearlinear increase in fire radiative energy density over a range of fuel consumption between 0.15 and 3.25 kg mÀ2. Using an integrated heat budget, we estimate that the fraction of total theoretical combustion energy density radiated from the plot averaged 0.17, the fraction of latent energy transported in the plume averaged 0.08, and the fraction accounted for by the combination of fire convective energy transport and soil heating averaged 0.72. Future work will require, at minimum, instantaneous and time-integrated estimates of energy transported by radiation, convection and soil heating across a range of fuels.},

  abstract   = {The maximum temperatures of thermocouples, temperature-sensitive paints, and calorimeters exposed to flames in wildland fires are often called ‘‘fire temperatures’’ but are determined as much by the properties and deployment of the measurement devices as by the fires themselves. Rather than report device temperatures that are not generally comparable among studies, we show that maximum and time-integrated temperatures of relatively thick (4.8 mm diameter) type-K thermocouple probes (TCPs) can be calibrated to estimate fuel consumption and fire line intensity in surface fires. Although reporting standard fire characteristics is an improvement over reporting device temperatures, TCPs are not ideal instruments for monitoring surface fires, because they provide only point estimates of fire behavior and must be calibrated for different fire environments, TCP characteristics, and deployments. To illustrate how TCPs respond to fires and to point the way towards a more general calibration method, we report results from a numerical model that accurately simulated TCP response to a spreading surface fire. Re´sume´ : La tempe´rature maximale des thermocouples, des peintures thermosensibles et des calorime`tres expose´s aux flammes produites par les feux de foreˆt est souvent appele´e « tempe´rature du feu » mais elle est de´termine´e aussi bien par les proprie´te´s et la fac¸on dont sont utilise´s ces appareils de mesure que par les feux eux-meˆmes. Plutoˆt que de rapporter la tempe´rature mesure´e par des appareils, laquelle n’est ge´ne´ralement pas comparable d’une e´tude a` l’autre, nous montrons que la tempe´rature maximale et la tempe´rature inte´gre´e dans le temps des sondes relativement e´paisses (4,8 mm de diame`tre) des thermocouples de type K (STCs) peuvent eˆtre calibre´es pour estimer la consommation de combustibles et l’intensite´ de la ligne de feu dans le cas des feux de surface.

  abstract = {A key determinant of wildfire behaviour is the flammability of constituent plants. One plant trait that influences flammability is the retention of dead biomass, as the low moisture content of dead material means less energy is required to achieve combustion. However, the effect of the dead-to-live ratio of fuel on plant flammability has rarely been experimentally quantified. Here we examine the nature of the relationship between dead fuel accumulation and flammability in Ulex europaeus (common gorse). Shoots with varying proportions of dead material were ignited in a purpose-built plant-burner. Three components of flammability were measured: sustainability (flame duration), consumability (proportion burnt biomass) and combustibility (maximum temperature). While flame duration and proportion burnt biomass had a positive linear relationship with the proportion of dead material, the response of maximum temperature was positive but non-linear. All three flammability components were reduced to a single variable using principal components analysis; this had a non-linear relationship with the proportion of dead material. The response of maximum temperature to dead material plateaued at 39\%. These findings have implications for the management of habitats invaded by gorse; to mitigate fire hazard associated with gorse, stands should be kept at a relatively young age when dead fuel is less prevalent.},

As for most model-fitting functions in R, the model is described in an lmer call by a formula, in this case including both fixed- and random-effects terms. The formula and data together determine a numerical representation of the model from which the profiled deviance or the profiled REML criterion can be evaluated as a function of some of the model parameters. The appropriate criterion is optimized, using one of the constrained optimization functions in R, to provide the parameter estimates. We describe the structure of the model, the steps in evaluating the profiled deviance or REML criterion, and the structure of classes or types that represents such a model. Sufficient detail is included to allow specialization of these structures by users who wish to write functions to fit specialized linear mixed models, such as models incorporating pedigrees or smoothing splines, that are not easily expressible in the formula language used by lmer.},

  abstract = {Thermocouple probes have long been standard equipment for wildland fire scientists. But despite substantial advancements in the electronic datalogger technology necessary to read and store data from thermocouples, the effective cost per thermocouple sensor of commercial systems has not decreased such that most researchers can afford to deploy enough sensors to account for the high degree of variability in wildland fire behavior. Because the equipment must endure the extreme conditions of wildland fire, is unlikely that any thermocouple datalogger system will be considered “cheap.” However, the growing number of applications of open-source, do-it-yourself (DIY) microcontroller systems in scientific research suggests these products might be employed in thermocouple datalogging systems if (1) their performance can be shown to be comparable to commercial systems and (2) they can be protected from exposure in the wildland fire environment. In this paper, we compare the performance of an Arduino MEGA microcontroller board relative to a Campbell Scientific CR1000, reading standard K-type metal overbraided ceramic fiber insulated thermocouple probes, under the constant temperature of a drying oven and the variable flame of a Bunsen burner. In both comparisons, we found that the variability among individual thermocouples, which are known to have a \$\${\textbackslash}pm{\textbackslash}, 2{\textbackslash},{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ \}{\textbackslash}hbox \{C\}\{-\}6{\textbackslash},{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ \}{\textbackslash}hbox \{C\}\$\$margin of error, was greater than between the dataloggers. We also describe a compact and mobile Arduino-based system capable of recording wildland fire flame temperatures in agris. In considering these three systems, it is clear that Arduino-based open-source, DIY components can support a compact, low-cost datalogger that accommodates more sensors for lower cost than proprietary commercial systems with no sacrifice in data quality. The combination of low-cost, multi-sensor units can contribute to better understanding of variability in wildland fire behavior.},

  abstract = {The realm of wildland fire science encompasses both wild and prescribed fires. Most of the research in the broader field has focused on wildfires, however, despite the prevalence of prescribed fires and demonstrated need for science to guide its application. We argue that prescribed fire science requires a fundamentally different approach to connecting related disciplines of physical, natural, and social sciences. We also posit that research aimed at questions relevant to prescribed fire will improve overall wildland fire science and stimulate the development of useful knowledge about managed wildfires. Because prescribed fires are increasingly promoted and applied for wildfire management and are intentionally ignited to meet policy and land manager objectives, a broader research agenda incorporating the unique features of prescribed fire is needed. We highlight the primary differences between prescribed fire science and wildfire science in the study of fuels, fire behavior, fire weather, fire effects, and fire social science. Wildfires managed for resource benefits (“managed wildfires”) offer a bridge for linking these science frameworks. A recognition of the unique science needs related to prescribed fire will be key to addressing the global challenge of managing wildland fire for long-term sustainability of natural resources.},
